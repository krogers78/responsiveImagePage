# Responsive Image Gallery
This web site utilizes the Unsplash API to pull images and meta data for the images into the browser. The gallery uses responsive images in an attempt to grab image sizes appropriate for the size of the browser it is being viewed in. The user can view the meta data for each image through the use of a hover effect and some animation as well as the logo spinning upon clicking the image.
